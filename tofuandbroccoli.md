#  Tofu and Broccoli Bowl (4 servings)

Quick and easy dish with few ingrediants. Tastes pretty good.
Ingredients:
* 3/4-1 Diced onion *i use yellow onion because it's better for pan frying*
* 1 full head of broccoli *make sure to cut most of the stem off, you want florets* 
* 16 oz tofu *hard or firm*
* Rice
* 1-2 cloves minced garlic
for the sauce:
* 1/2-1 tsp chili garlic sauce
* 1/2-1 tsp sesame oil 
* 1/4 cup soy sauce (i use a little less)
* 2 tsp grated giger

To make:
* press tofu
	** put the tofu in a paper towel wrap in a clean dish cloth, rest a really heavy object (pot of water, all the harry potter books, etc) and let sit for 15 minutes to press out all the water
* mix together the sauce, let sit
* wash and cut onions, garlic, and broccoli
* cut tofu into bite sized cubes
* heat up a large pan, once a drop of water can sizzle off in a couple seconds, drizzle 3 tsp of sesame oil *you may use more to cover the pan, but be careful because sesame oil is very strong*
* drop in onions, let sit but stir occasionally  
* after onions become translucent, add in tofu and broccoli. Stir and let sit until broccoli is cooked (about 8 min)
* add in sauce, stir, turn heat down and let sit for a couple minutes
* serve over rice/noodles, garnish with green onions, sesame seeds, and/or siracha
